you need to send a post request with JSON obj:
{
    "from":"language code",
    "to":"language code",
    "text":"Text to translate",
    "key":"access_key"
    }   

and will return:
[{
    "detectedLanguage":{
        "language":"language code",
        "score": integer from 0-1 with 1 being very certain to 0 being uncertain
        },
    "translations":[{
        "text":"Translated Text",
        "to":"language code"
        }]
    }]

The language code can be found here: https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/languages?api-version=3.0

You must request an access_key through me if you want to use this service
